                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a technology delivery lead with experience in building and leading teams across the software delivery lifecycle, including operations support roles. I have a strong architectural background and ability to consider the technology implications across an organisation's operating model.

           <br>
                <p>
                    Currently working for Accenture, I have worked across consulting, delivery, architecture and business development roles, identifying opportunities for growth and building relationships with clients to secure a solution that delivers the best result for both organisations.
                </p>

                <p>
